# Individual Project
## Individual Project for 4th year CompSci at University of Glasgow

This project is a programming language tranlator, supervises by Derek Sommerville. The project proposal was as follows:


Research the open source porgramming language translator and find their gaps.
Enhnace or write a programme language convertor/translator.



Evaluate by running on open source programs to confirm the success translation.
How much of the language funciotnality is used. How easy is the code to read and
maintain. What design patterns are covered.



Possible translations

Java -> C#

Java -> Python

My aim for this project is to first research the current availability of coding language translators available online and learn from them a criteria of what makes a good translator. I will use this information to help my develop a product which hopefully overcomes issues that have previously been faced by other translators. I will also have to study the languages to gain a good understanding of where they differ as this will provide me with edge cases where my translations may become problematic.
I intend to focus primarily on going to and from python and java as these are the two languages I feel most competent in and have learnt the most about throughout my time at university.
